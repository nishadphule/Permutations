What are Permutations :

Say you are given a string for example "ABC" so the possible permutations of the given string are number of ways in which you can print the given string with characters in different orders.
So the permutations of given string would be :
"ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CAB", "CBA"

So to print such a series head on to the code section to find out how you can print a series like this using Recursion as well as Iteration.
